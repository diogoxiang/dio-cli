# vue-mix
SPA boilerplate for your Vue 2.0 projects using [laravel-mix](https://github.com/jeffreyway/laravel-mix).

## Setup
**Clone the repository**
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/cklmercer/vue-mix
```

**Move into the the project directory**
```bash
$ cd vue-mix
```

**Install dependencies**

$ yarn install
```
_or_
```bash
$ npm install
```

**Complete the initial build**
```bash
$ npm run build
```

**Start a dev server**

```

## Development
Once you got the project built and you have a dev server running, you're free to begin developing.
With your dev server running, hot module reloading _(HMR)_ is enabled by default, simply make some
changes to your code and watch as your browser _"refreshes"_ itself automatically.
